    His passing has inspired an outpouring of tributes from across the globe, celebrating not only his remarkable achievements but the values that shaped his life—compassion, humility, and a profound sense of service to others. The state funeral he received, with India’s flag draped over his coffin and prayers from priests of all faiths, was a testament to the love and respect he earned from people of all walks of life

      <h2>The spirit of giving</h2>
      <p>
        Under Ratan Tata’s leadership, 65% of Tata Group’s profits were directed to charitable causes, supporting education, healthcare, scientific research, and countless other initiatives designed to improve lives. This was not simply a corporate policy—it reflected Tata’s deep belief that the success of any organisation should be measured by how much it contributes to society. By March 2024, Tata Group’s total donations had reached $102 billion, an extraordinary sum that mirrors the family’s commitment to making a positive difference in the world.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Ratan Tata may not have accumulated great personal wealth during his lifetime, but today, he is mourned by a billion people. His legacy teaches us that true success is not about how much we acquire but about how much we give. He showed us that leadership is defined not by what we gain but by how we serve. As I reflect on Ratan Tata’s life, I am reminded of the path I, too, wish to follow: to lead with purpose, to use business as a tool for good, and to create a legacy that extends far beyond financial success.
